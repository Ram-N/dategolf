## [review] CSV rows triaged as duplicate / not recommended (incl. date conflicts)

- `csv 3` — duplicate_of_existing → egyptian-pyramids-built — DATE CONFLICT: CSV says c. 3000 BC, the app says 2560 BCE (the span construction-great-pyramid is -2580..-2560).
- `csv 15` — duplicate_of_existing → birth-of-buddha — DATE CONFLICT: CSV says c. 576 BC, the app says 563 BCE. Row 20 gives a third date.
- `csv 20` — duplicate_of_existing → birth-of-buddha — DATE CONFLICT: CSV says 486 BC, row 15 says c. 576 BC, the app says 563 BCE. Scholarly estimates range from c. 563 to c. 480 BCE.
- `csv 5` — not_recommended — Reviewed 2026-11-06: no matching event and not added for now (minor, vague, or covered by another event's description). Could be added later at low importance (1-2).
- `csv 22` — not_recommended → platos-academy-founded — 'The period of Aristotle and Plato' is an era, not a datable event. Could become a time span.
